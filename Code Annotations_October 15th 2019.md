# Annotations While Reading

Ford, Paul. ‘What is Code?’ http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/

*The CTO was fired six months ago. That CTO has three kids in college and a mustache.*

Just coming from my perspective, I think it would be really helpful if this piece used the full phrase at least once before jumping to the acronym. It saves time as I'm not left questioning and trying to see the bigger picture.

*“My people are split on platform,” he continues. “Some want to use Drupal 7 and make it work with Magento—which is still PHP.” He frowns. “The other option is just doing the back end in Node.js with Backbone in front.”*

Weird/Worrying: I have no idea what any of this dialogue means! All I'm grasping from the exchange is that they're trying to decide which platform is best.

*So that’s what I’m writing: my view of software development, as an individual among millions.*

Wonderful: I really like this opening, and I like how it ties back to the 'What is Digital Humanities' page we looked at last class. Both DH and Code have a limitless amount of perspectives.

*Tick, check if the result is zero, and if it is, go to some other box and follow a new set of instructions.*

Weird: does this really happen in code? I don't really understand a whole lot about the mechanics, but what is the point of having the first operation if it doesn't do anything/sends you to a new one?

*You, using a pen and paper, can do anything a computer can; you just can’t do those things billions of times per second. And those billions of tiny operations add up.*

Wonderful: it's kind of interesting to think about how a computer is like the human brain except operating at a much faster speed.

*So many things are computers, or will be. That includes watches, cameras, air conditioners, cash registers, toilets, toys, airplanes, and movie projectors. Samsung makes computers that look like TVs, and Tesla makes computers with wheels and engines. Some things that aren’t yet computers—dental floss, flashlights—will fall eventually.*

Wonderful with a hint of worry: I know the author here is just genuinely describing our reality at the moment, but I can't have but catch the 'worried' tone of voice he's communicating regarding how many things in our lives will eventually be computers. It really makes you stop and think "yes this is possible, but is having computer dental floss necessary?"

*You can make computers do wonderful things, but you need to understand their limits. They’re not all-powerful, not conscious in the least.*

I think about this train of thought a lot. I knew a CompSci student through a roommate who thought computers would one day be able to model the brain in its entirety and be able to use human language on its own. This was troubling for both my roommate and I (both linguistics students), as we were under the assumption that computers were based off the brain and not the other way around. I sometimes wonder if it's even possible to recreate a computer in the image of a brain, but I think if that's ever to be a reality there's still a lot of work that needs to be done in terms of understanding the brain.

*Kind of like a sentence diagram.*

Wonderful: like a syntax tree!

*For not only are computers as dumb as a billion marbles, they’re also positively Stradivarian in their delicacy.*

This reminds of the brain thought I had earlier, and I guess also goes to show one key difference between human brains and computers. Brains are really good at sorting out problems in real time and on the go, where as computers are a lot less tolerant to mistakes.

*So in that sense, algorithms can be pure, mathematical entities as well as practical expressions of ideas on which you can place your grubby hands.*

So algorithms are another tool that both code and digital humanities utilize?

*C is a simple language, simple like a shotgun that can blow off your foot*

Weird: is this metaphor insinuating only that C is powerful, or also that it's dangerous? That was my first thought when I read this line and now I'm uncertain which interpretation Paul Ford meant.

*In many ways the idiom of a language is not just how it looks but also how it feels. Some languages emphasize brevity. Some support long, complex functions, while others encourage you to break up functionality into small pieces.*

Wonderful: This reminds of the various typologies languages can have; agglutinative (long and complex strings of morphemes) versus analytic (easier to break down into small pieces) languages, for example.

*But now that software can be released via the Web or an app store, why wait? Why not continually release software, every day, whenever you have something that’s ready to go?*

Worrying: this alludes to the fact that the expected workload from coders becomes far greater than what is humanly possible
