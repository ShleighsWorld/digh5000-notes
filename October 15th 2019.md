About the stories you tell about the code and with the code

The code is a loop, we read it left to right. This program runs forever. PRINT prints something to the screen. Where does it print to?

There are fossils with the code that helps us understand what parts of it mean. CHR is short for character. RND means round (it means random too).

It picks either character 205 or 206.

Coding something is an act of translation. We have to translate it from something from our reality to something the computer understands.

A whole bunch of stuff has been coded out of the years

Idea of recursive and recursion

Coding their own worst impulses into their creations. Code needs to be pulled apart by humanists. Don't need to code, but need to know enough about code to know where the problems lie.

Ada Lovelace is relagated to a footnote

When something starts getting money attached to it, white men are drawn to it

Alan Turing: the mind behind the computing engine that deciphers the enigma machine. Coding is entangled with so many socio-political problems.

**What is an algorithm?**

It is just a recipe. An instruction. A series of steps. 

PHP: abstracting data out of databases.  The right language depends on what kind of recipe your building.

You can represent information in lots of different ways.

We understand the things that are missing in this text with no vowels. Idea: you can lose a lot of information and still get the message through. Zipping: reducing information of a file greatly.

It's too important to leave in the hands of engineers; we need humanities at the interface.

CLOUD: meant to unload responsibility and power

Writing an algorithm that... helps you decide which language you should commit to learning next.

You need subcategories

Yes or no questions: expert systems. Also used in medical examinations. Also for decision trees and graphs.

## Divinding up work for Group Project: Mapping Landscape

One place we might wanna start...create a channal in our Slack space. Look at various school websites to find out who is doing DH work to get an idea of who is out there.
