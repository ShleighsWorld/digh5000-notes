The tech stuff will come when you want to analyze a problem

*DH Hype Cycle*

2006: DH first coined

2013: DH reaches crest of curse

2017: DH is going to ruin academia! attitude

2019: hype has worn off, backlash is exhausted, we can figure out what good it can be used for

*Some words from the board*

Power, streaming, tools, politics, semiotics, games, engagement, accessibility, silences, post-colonial DH, who gets to speak?, narrative development

The labour of this class that the world will see will be outward facing work

Project: Landscape of DH in Ottawa

Want to know what this landscape looks like/create representation for it

A map metaphorically or literally

Topic to talk about in class: Primer textbook from two years ago for a starting point

*Quotes I like from whatisdigitalhumanities*

“DH breaks open opportunities to ask and research new questions in humanities, stimulates novel approaches and visualizations of humanities work, and gives us a chance to make more effective relevant interventions to broader publics. Kristin Koptiuch”

“The Digital Humanities are an umbrella discipline for humanities scholars and educators who adopt digital technology as the environment for the curation, organization, production and dissemination of their scholarship and as a platform for their teaching, with the objective to enable sharper focus on the qualitative evaluation of information that is at the core of humanistic inquiry. Silvia Stoyanova”

Stuff with meta: gets ingested by google, library search engines, this is what we are changing

Script and link define the inner activity: how to go and get that bit of random information and display it on the screen

Style: how stuff is gonna look
Grab…: how the quote is actually pulled

4.	Setting>Github pages>master branch

.md is important. 'md' means 'markdown' ,- just a text file with a bit of semantic signs in it, eg:
